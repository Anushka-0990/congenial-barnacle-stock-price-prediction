Dataset: Real-time Stock Price Data using Yahoo Finance
No need to download anything manually.

We use Python’s `yfinance` package to directly fetch historical stock prices.

Example stock symbol used: AAPL (Apple Inc.)

To use another stock, just change the ticker in the code, e.g.:
    yfinance.download("TSLA")  → for Tesla
